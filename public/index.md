# Rules

Two players take turns picking coins from a selection of bags. Each coin has its own value, and the goal of the game is to get a higher total sum of coin values than your opponent. The coin you get from selecting a bag is picked at random. The values of the coins are determined by the players before the game begins. 

Extra game options include: 
Bag Count - choose how many bags should be in play.
Difficulty - In hard mode, if a player exceeds total coin value of 100, they lose the game.
Peeking - allows players to see the coin values in each bag.
